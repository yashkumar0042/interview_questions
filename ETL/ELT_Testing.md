Q#001. What strategies do you use to create granular and reusable test cases across different modules?

As a Quality Engineer specializing in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) testing, creating granular and reusable test cases is crucial for efficient testing. Here are some strategies you can employ:

1. **Requirement Analysis:**
   - Start by thoroughly understanding the ETL process and the business requirements.
   - Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable units to identify different modules and their functionalities.

2. **Modular Test Case Design:**
   - Design test cases at a modular level, focusing on individual components or modules within the ETL process.
   - Each test case should cover a specific functionality, transformation logic, or data flow within a module.

3. **Parameterization:**
   - Use parameterization to make test cases adaptable to different scenarios.
   - Incorporate variables or parameters for input data, expected outcomes, and other configurable elements to increase reusability.

4. **Data-Driven Testing:**
   - Implement data-driven testing approaches where test cases are driven by external datasets.
   - Create a repository of test data that covers various scenarios, allowing you to reuse the same test cases with different input datasets.

5. **Reusable Functions:**
   - Develop reusable functions or libraries for common testing actions.
   - Functions may include data validation, comparison, error handling, and logging, which can be used across multiple test cases.

6. **Scenario-based Testing:**
   - Identify and create test cases based on different scenarios, such as normal processing, error handling, and boundary conditions.
   - Ensure that each scenario is covered independently and can be reused in various test suites.

7. **Parameterized SQL Queries:**
   - If your ETL involves database interactions, use parameterized SQL queries for database testing.
   - This allows you to reuse the same query structure with different parameters for testing different data scenarios.

8. **Regression Testing Suites:**
   - Build regression testing suites that encompass critical functionalities and scenarios.
   - Re-run these suites whenever there are changes to the ETL process or underlying systems to ensure that existing functionalities are not affected.

9. **Test Data Generation:**
   - Develop strategies for generating test data dynamically or programmatically.
   - This ensures that you can create and maintain test data easily, promoting the reusability of test cases.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Document test cases comprehensively, including inputs, expected results, and any assumptions made during the design.
    - Clearly specify the purpose of each test case and its dependencies to facilitate easy understanding and reuse.

11. **Version Control:**
    - Implement version control for test cases to track changes and maintain a history of modifications.
    - This ensures that the latest and most relevant test cases are used for testing.

By employing these strategies, you can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of your ETL testing efforts while promoting the creation of granular and reusable test cases across different modules.

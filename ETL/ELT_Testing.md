Q#001. What strategies do you use to create granular and reusable test cases across different modules?

As a Quality Engineer specializing in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) testing, creating granular and reusable test cases is essential for efficient and effective testing across different modules. Here are some strategies you can employ:

Requirement Analysis:

Understand the ETL process and the specific requirements of each module.
Break down the overall functionality into smaller, manageable components.
Modular Test Case Design:

Design test cases that focus on testing individual components or functionalities within each module.
Ensure that each test case has a specific and well-defined objective.
Parameterization:

Use parameterization to make test cases adaptable to different data sets.
Allow input parameters to be easily configured to test various scenarios and data variations.
Data-Driven Testing:

Implement data-driven testing techniques to separate test data from test logic.
Create a repository of test data that can be reused across different modules.
Test Data Generation:

Develop a strategy for generating diverse and representative test data.
Create reusable scripts or tools for generating synthetic data to cover a wide range of scenarios.
Reusable Functions and Libraries:

Identify common functionalities or validation checks across modules.
Implement reusable functions or libraries for common tasks such as data validation, error handling, and logging.
Automation Frameworks:

Utilize automation frameworks that support modularity and reusability.
Structure your automation scripts to be easily maintainable and adaptable to changes in the ETL process.
Parameterized Workflows:

If applicable, design test cases that mimic different workflow scenarios.
Parameterize workflows to cover variations in the ETL process.
Regression Testing Suites:

Maintain regression testing suites that include a comprehensive set of reusable test cases.
Regularly update and expand the regression suites to cover new functionalities and changes.
Documentation:

Document each test case with clear instructions, expected results, and any specific configurations required.
Ensure that documentation is easily accessible and understandable for other team members.
Collaboration with Development:

Collaborate with developers to understand the architecture and design of ETL processes.
Incorporate feedback from development to enhance the robustness of test cases.
Continuous Improvement:

Regularly review and refine test cases based on feedback and lessons learned.
Keep abreast of changes in ETL processes and technologies to update test cases accordingly.
